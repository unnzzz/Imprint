# Imprint
Imprint is a social media for people who are driven to make the world a sustainable place to live in. It is an idea inspired by the 17 sustainability goals of the United Nations. People could log in and select tasks under the 17 goals and post pictures after the completion of tasks to earn Sustainability points. I've added in features to like, comment , edit posts, to see follower count and to follow users. A user could also edit his/her/their profile and look at their sustainability points which increase as you complete tasks. Users could also send messages to each other and use pictures to enhance their messaging experience.

# Imprint
Imprint is a social media for people who are driven to make the world a sustainable place to live in. It is an idea inspired by the 17 sustainability goals of the United Nations. People could log in and select tasks under the 17 goals and post pictures after the completion of tasks to earn Sustainability points. I've added in features to like, comment , edit posts, to see follower count and to follow users. A user could also edit his/her/their profile and look at their sustainability points which increase as you complete tasks. Users could also send messages to each other and use pictures to enhance their messaging experience.

Why Imprint? \
To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced to net zero by 2050. Bold, fast, and wide-ranging action needs to be taken by governments and businesses. But the transition to a low-carbon world also requires the participation of citizens – especially in advanced economies.
Imprint derives inspiration from the United Nations campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability.
Every one of us can help limit global warming and take care of our planet. By making choices that have less harmful effects on the environment, we can be part of the solution and influence change.
